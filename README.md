### Introduction

Welcome to my eCommerce, the result of a React project.

------------

### Description

On the page you can find an example of an eCommerce, which is based on the sale of paints. You will be able to navigate in the categories you want, and you will be able to see the functionality of the whole project, from how to search for your product to checkout.

------------

### Libraries

These are the libraries that were used in the project:

- Chakra-UI, it was used to shape and style most of the components you can see in the application.

- React-Router-DOM, the one in charge of managing the routes of the components of the project. 

- Font Awesome, in charge of providing the icons to the page.

##### Database

As a database for this project we used Firebase, with a simple but useful management to store our products in the cloud and call them from the database, and on the other hand, was responsible for receiving the purchase information from the customer, taking care of saving the orders.
